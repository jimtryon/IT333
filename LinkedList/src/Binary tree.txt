Binary Tree

A binary tree is a finite set of elements that is either empty or consists ofâ€¦
- a single element called the root

- two subtrees, called left and right

Note: This definition is recursive!

Terminology
B = left child of A

C = right child of A

A = parent of B and C


Level - the number of branches on the path from the root

Depth - the maximum level of any leaf (one less than the height)

Height - the number of nodes on the longest path 


Preorder (left)
1. Visit the root
2. Traverse the left subtree
3. Traverse the right subtree
ABDC

Inorder (bottom)
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Visit the root
3. Traverse the right subtree
BDAC

Postorder (right)
1. Traverse the left subtree
2. Traverse the right subtree
3. Visit the root

Balanced tree

A binary tree in which the height of the left subtree and right subtree differ by no more than one
